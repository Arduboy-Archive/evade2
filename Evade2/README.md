# Evade 2

Evade 2 is an Arduboy game developed by Modus Create as a holiday gift to friends and family in December 2018.

The game took about 3 weeks to create, from start to finish.

Please see the Arduboy game we made last year, Evade.

This repository contains the source code to the game, which we're making freely available and open source.

We believe we pushed the Arduboy hardware in ways that will benefit future programming efforts.  Feel free to use the
source code here to enhance your own projects.  Or feel free to make your own improvements to Evade 2 for your own 
pleasure.
